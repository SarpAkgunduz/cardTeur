# CardTeur Coding Rules

## CSS & Theme
- Dark theme colors: background `#1A2B42`, panel bg `rgba(36, 59, 90, 0.75)`, accent `#00deec`, error `#ff6b6b`
- Headers matching the navbar style: `background: rgba(36, 59, 90, 0.85); backdrop-filter: blur(12px); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1); height: 64px`
- Section headers (e.g. PreviewPage position groups): `background: rgba(36, 59, 90, 0.75); border-left: 3px solid #00deec; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0`
- All buttons use the `.btn-ct` class, active/cancel state is toggled with `.active-mode`
- CSS class naming: BEM-like, `component-name__element` format (e.g. `players-grid__item`)
- Each page/component has its own CSS file, shared global styles live in `global.css`
- Prefer `cubic-bezier` for animations, `transition` durations between 0.3–0.5s
- Inline edit controls (pencil icon) should be hidden by default and revealed on `.row:hover` via `opacity: 0 → 1`

## React Patterns
- Keep state at the nearest common ancestor (lifting state up) — use Context only when the tree is genuinely deep
- Do not manipulate child state from parent via `useImperativeHandle` + `ref`
- Extract a custom hook (like `usePlayerForm`) only when the same logic is reused in multiple places or the page grows too large
- Control Bootstrap components with the `show` prop instead of conditional mounting so animations work
- Mode buttons (edit/compare/delete) must be mutually exclusive — activating one closes the others
- Inline edit pattern: `editingId` + `editingValue` state, `startEdit` / `cancelEdit` / `saveX` handlers, keyboard shortcuts `Enter` = save, `Escape` = cancel

## Page & Feature Architecture
- `PreviewPage` is a read-only roster grouped by position (GK → DEF → MID → ATT). No edit actions here.
- `CrewPage` (`/crew`) handles contact info (email). Email is managed here, not in `AddPlayerForm`.
- `AddPlayerForm` is strictly for player stats and identity (name, position, jersey, market value, image, stats). No contact fields.
- `PlayersPage` is the CRUD hub — manage, delete, compare modes.
- When a feature clearly belongs to a different page's concern, move it there instead of adding it to the current page.

## TypeScript
- Type definitions are kept in sync between `openteur/src/services/api/types.ts` and `server/models/Player.ts`
- When adding a new Player field, update both sides together
- `email` is optional (`email?: string`) — never required, never validated in forms
- `cardTitle` is a backend virtual — never sent in create/update payloads

## Authentication
- Auth state lives in `openteur/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` via `<AuthProvider>`. Always use the `useAuth()` hook to access `currentUser`, `signIn`, and `signOut` — never read auth from localStorage directly.
- `getCurrentUserToken()` in `AuthService.tsx` returns the Firebase ID token; use it when making raw `fetch` calls outside of `apiRequest()` (e.g. `MatchPage.tsx`).
- Never hardcode Firebase config values in source files. They come from `openteur/.env` as `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variables.
- `server/serviceAccountKey.json` contains private credentials — never commit it, never log it, never expose it to the frontend.
